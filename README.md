# Parallel-Bitwise-Addition
Parallel bit-wise addition has been a long standing problem, as addition of 2 numbers involves the sequential calculation of the Carry. There have been a lot of methods that have been implemented for reducing the time for adding 2 large numbers of n bits, including methods such as pipelining, but they all yield a worst case solution of O(n).

This project involves proposing a new method of parallel addition under constant time. This project also involves simulating parallel bit-wise addition of 2 numbers using arrays in C++.
